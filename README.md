# Pore segmentation of the lamina cribrosa for glaucoma assessment

Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, encompasses a range of disorders characterized by optic nerve damage. Among these, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is a significant subset, marked by progressive visual field loss. It is distinguished by an open anterior chamber angle and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) without any underlying disease. When an identifiable cause for the elevated IOP is present, the condition is classified as secondary glaucoma.

The lamina cribrosa (LC) plays a critical role in the optic nerve head, providing nutrition to the retinal nerve fiber bundles (RNFBs) through its connective tissue structure. Elevated IOP can cause deformation of the lamina cribrosa pores, disrupting the axonal arrangement, oxygenation, and blood flow necessary for maintaining optic nerve function. Understanding these changes is pivotal for advancing the diagnosis and treatment of POAG. However, the state of the art in this area remains limited, with few articles and recent observations shedding light on these processes.

To address this challenge, we utilized a Flood Illumination Adaptive Optics (FIAO) camera for imaging the optic nerve head. This imaging technique offers high-resolution images with a flashed flood source at 850 nm, capturing a 4° × 4° retinal area (equivalent to 1.2 mm × 1.2 mm) with a lateral resolution of 2 µm. Imaging is conducted in a dark room to facilitate high-quality capture without the need for pharmacological pupil dilation. Nonetheless, pores of the LC might be obscured by microstructures, which decrease the visibility of the region of interest (ROI), i.e., the pores, and thus their segmentation. Figure 1 shows an example of this phenomenon and illustrates the challenge of deciding which structures were relevant.

The goal of this project was not to determine whether an image came from a glaucoma patient, but simply to segment the pores of interest for each lamina as well as possible.
