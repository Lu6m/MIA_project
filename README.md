The aim is to segment and characterize the pores of the cribriform plate (FIG. 1), in images acquired using Adaptive Optics. The lamina is a porous structure located in the head of the optic nerve, through which nerve fibers from the retina to the brain. In AO images, the pores are the dark areas. They change shape in pathologies such as glaucoma. Thus, segmenting the pores of the cribriform plate and deducing their size and shape characteristics can help to better model the pathology and its evolution.
